Hi,

Muscle Tribe is a project built using Reactjs, this app allows you to view and learn various exercises, you can search an exercise of your choice and watch how it's done by watching the results of your search.

I made use of an API that provides me with all the details of the exercise, this API also supports query search.

you can also watch similar exercies in the similar exercises tab mentioned just below the details page of a particular exercise, which also has youtube videos(provided by the API). 

here is a working video of the app.
There is also a pricing page that displays the pricing plans of the gym service provider.
